Visualizing our Neural Network Graph
ANN Visualizer is a python library that enables us to visualize an Artificial Neural Network using just a single line of code. It is used to work with Keras and makes use of python’s graphviz library to create a neat and presentable graph of the neural network you’re building.
With advanced in deep learning, you can now visualise the entire deep learning process or just the Convolutional Neural Network you’ve built.
We are going to build simple neural network using keras and then use ANNvisualizer to visualize our neural network.
Here I have used Google Colab, so libraries can be installed:
!pip3 install keras
!pip3 install ann_visualizer
!pip install graphviz
After we run our code, we use graphviz source for visualizaing graph
